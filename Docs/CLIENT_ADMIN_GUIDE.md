# Client Portal Guide

## Overview
The Client Portal allows you to manage your company's financial relationship with us. You can view invoices, make payments, and approve quotes.

## 1. Accessing the Portal

1.  Log in to your support account.
2.  Click on your **Profile Avatar** in the top right.
3.  Select **"Billing & Finance"**.

*Note: You must have "Billing Admin" permissions to see this menu.*

## 2. Managing Invoices

### Viewing Invoices
The dashboard shows a summary of your account status:
*   **Total Due:** The sum of all unpaid invoices.
*   **Past Due:** Amount overdue.

Below the summary is a list of all invoices. Click **"View PDF"** to download a formal copy for your records.

### Making a Payment
1.  Click **"Pay Now"** next to an unpaid invoice.
2.  **Select Payment Method:**
    *   **Credit Card:** Enter your card details (processed securely via Stripe).
    *   **ACH / Bank Transfer:** Enter your bank routing and account number.
3.  **Auto-Pay:** Check "Save this method for future automatic payments" to avoid manual payments next month.

## 3. Quotes & Estimates

When you request new hardware or services, we will send you a digital quote.

### Reviewing a Quote
1.  You will receive an email with a link to the quote.
2.  Alternatively, view **"Open Quotes"** in the Billing Portal.
3.  The quote details the services, hardware, and estimated monthly costs.

### Approving/Declining
*   **Approve:** Click the **"Accept & Sign"** button. You may be asked to type your name as a digital signature. This will automatically convert the quote into an order.
*   **Decline:** If you do not wish to proceed, you can decline the quote. Optionally, leave a comment explaining why (e.g., "Budget constraints").

## 4. Payment Methods

You can manage your stored cards and bank accounts under the **"Settings"** tab.
*   **Add New:** Add a backup payment method.
