# Technician Billing Guide

## Overview
As a technician, your primary focus is solving client issues. However, accurate data entry is critical for the billing system to function. This guide explains how to ensure your work is billed correctly.

## 1. Time Tracking & Billable Hours

Every ticket interaction is an opportunity to capture revenue or justify the value of a managed service contract.

### Logging Time
When adding a note or closing a ticket:
1.  **Time Spent:** Enter the duration in minutes or hours.
2.  **Billable Toggle:**
    *   **Checked (Default):** The time will be billed to the client (either deducted from a block or added to an invoice).
    *   **Unchecked:** The time is non-billable (e.g., fixing a mistake, internal training).
3.  **Work Type:** Select the appropriate type (e.g., "Remote Support", "On-Site", "Project Work"). This affects the billing rate.

### Best Practices
*   **Be Descriptive:** Invoice line items often pull from ticket subjects or time entry notes. "Fixed it" is not a good description for a client invoice. Use "Resolved printer connectivity issue by updating drivers."
*   **Real-Time Entry:** Log time immediately. "Batching" time entries at the end of the week leads to lost revenue.

## 2. Expenses & Parts

If you use hardware from inventory or incur expenses (parking, cables) while working on a ticket, you must log them.

### Adding Products/Parts
1.  Open the Ticket.
2.  Locate the **"Billing & Materials"** section.
3.  **Search Product:** Type to search the inventory catalog (e.g., "HDMI Cable 6ft").
4.  **Quantity:** Enter the amount used.
5.  **Add:** The system will automatically deduct from inventory and add a line item to the client's next invoice.

### Adding Expenses
1.  In the **"Billing & Materials"** section, select **"Add Expense"**.
2.  **Description:** e.g., "Parking at Client Site".
3.  **Cost:** The amount you paid (for reimbursement).
4.  **Billable Amount:** The amount to charge the client (usually Cost + Markup).
5.  **Attach Receipt:** Upload a photo or PDF of the receipt.

## 3. Inventory Lookup

You can check stock levels before heading to a client site.
1.  Navigate to **Inventory**.
2.  Search for the item.
3.  Check **"Stock on Hand"** and **"Reserved"** counts.
